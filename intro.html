			<p>&emsp;Greetings！Welcome to Eclipsed ADGE, my personal website. I first like to appreciate your interest about my website and hope you like it!</p>
			<p>&emsp;My name is Haolin Xia (夏昊霖), who has just graduated from University of Ottawa in 2020, majoring computer science. Because of the influence of COVID-19, I have to stay home for a considerable period of time. During this time, I built this website. This is an independent and self-funded project. I write all codes for every section except Article. And for that, I use WordPress, because it would be easier to post contents. Also, this website will be maintained only by me, at least for now.</p>
			<p>&emsp;This website has four sections, so far. A home page, of course, a photo page listing all my photography works, an article page summarizing my posted articles, and this introductory page. Don’t hesitate to visit if you are interested.</p>
			<p>&emsp;Other than personal websites designed for job hunting, Eclipsed ADGE is a place more like a playground for me. I will periodically post something related to my interests, including music, photography, film, anime, video game, and more. Comments are available, so feel free to interact with me (but please avoid posting meaningless messages). However, since my first language is Chinese, most of content will be written in Chinese. (No worry! I will make a brief English summary, perhaps……)</p>
			<p>&emsp;Have fun!</p>
